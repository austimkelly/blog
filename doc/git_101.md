**git** is a distributed version control system invented by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) in 2005. Linus is otherwise mostly famous for inventing the Linux kernel. By "distrubted version control", we mean that there can be multiple copies of a source code repositories where software developers will have their own copy of the version contol system on their own computers and another version exists in a centeralized server. This distrubion allows software developers to easily work independently without needing constant connection to a centeralized server. While git is free an open source, most sofware development teams will use a managed version of git such as [Github](https://github.com/), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

The basis of good software engineering and team collaboration relies on a fundamental understanding of common git commands. If you are new to git, or even to working in a collaborative software environment, here's a collection of bare minimum things you need to know. The documentation references here are from https://git-scm.com/docs/.

This documentation is very dry, so you may want to consult the equivalent docs for the git service you are using. All these commands are supported by modern IDEs as well such as VS Code, XCode, etc. Hence, the critical part is that you intellectually understand what each of these commands is used for and how it applies to your own development environment.

# The very basics

* `git clone` - Before doing anything useful you need to clone a repository to have a copy on our local development machine. See [Cloning a repository](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone).

* `Branch Management` - It's critical you understand the concept of branching, creating branches, and checking out branches. See [Branch Management](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branch-Management)

* `git checkout` - Git checkout will allow you to checkout a specific branch. See [git-checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)

* `git commit` - A commit will record yoru changes to your local repository. See [git commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)

* `git push` - A push allow you to move your changes from a (local) commit to a remote server (e.g. Github). See [push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) documentation.

# Collaborative development

The section above provides the very basics you should know to be able to work on our own code. The following basics are crucial for collaborative team development.

* `git pull` - A pull fetches code from a remote repositry. Especially useful if another developer has added new changes to the same branch you are on. See [pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) documentation.

* `git merge` - A merge is performed to move code history from one branch to another. See [merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge).

* Pull requests - You should be able to create, review, comment, approve, reject, and merge pull requests. The workflow is best described in a git providers docs. See [Github's Pull Request documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for an overview.

* Resolving merge conflicts - This will happen to everyone eventually so get familiar with it. See Github's docs on [managing merge conflicts on the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line).

# Advanced

* Gitflow - Finally, when you put together all your basics and learn to really do collaborative development and work within a CI/CD model, Gitflow is the most common development pattern teams follow for team development throughout an SDLC. See http://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html

* `git rebase` - See [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) documentation.

* `git remote` - This is crucial to really understanding how distributed version control works. See [remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote) documentation.

* forking a repository. Fork any public repository to make it your own! See [Github's docs on forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
